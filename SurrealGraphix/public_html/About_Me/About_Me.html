	Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Joel Youngberg. Ever since I can remember I
 	have loved art and computers. From the early inspiration that I received from my older
 	sister Kim McWhorter, who is an excellent painter, to the urgings of my teachers in
 	school, I have always loved the union between art and computers.  Many people believe
 	that a person can only be a right-brained, artistic, creative, designer type OR a
 	left-brained, logical, mathematical, scientific type of person. While it is true that
 	one of the two types will come more naturally to particular individuals; I say “Why
 	not challenge yourself and use your whole brain, not just half of it!” The intersection
 	of art and the computer have created marvelous new things in our day, and opened career
 	fields that never existed in the past. We now have the web, video games, and movies with
 	special effects that were unheard of a few decades ago. Exciting careers in areas such
 	as web design, 3D game design, and computer-generated special effects are now commonplace.
 	With the rapid improvements in technology that we see constantly, I look forward to what
 	the future holds for us in the world of computer-generated art.
